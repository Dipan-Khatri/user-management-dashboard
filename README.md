 Technologies Used
React

Vite

Radix UI

MockAPI (for mock user data)

Future Enhancements:

a) User authentication and authorization: I plan to add authentication features to ensure that only authorized users can access the dashboard and manage users.

b) Role-based access control: Different user roles will be implemented to restrict certain actions to administrators only, enhancing security and control.
